In my marketing career, I've learned a profound truth about myself - I am incredibly passionate about building things and working with data. The more I work with our advertising performance data, the more I learn to love programming languages and what they can do for us. I love spending my free time learning more about the technologies listed above and I'm hoping to turn this passion into a career where I can grow my skills and contribute to building and optimizing tools with like-minded teammates.
